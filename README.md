# Lyman

This directory deals more with the images in the Lyman-alpha image created by Keck. These are created by making stamps from the broadband mosaic image being subtracted from the narrowband image. The Asymmetries directory shows the results from the asymmetry.py code, however. Project is the directory for the stamps from the HST images, so that the Lyman-alpha could be overlaid as contours on top of the HST stamps. LymProject is the directory for the Lyman-alpha stamps that were created with stamps.py. LymCatalog contains images with the HST stamp on the left, the Lyman-alpha stamp (resampled to HST pizel scale) in the middle and the Lyman-alpha contours overlayed on the HST stamp on the right. The code to create these is lymoverlays.py.
