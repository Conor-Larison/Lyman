# Lyman

This directory deals more with the images in the Lyman-alpha image created by Keck. These are created by making stamps from the broadband mosaic image being subtracted from the narrowband image. The Asymmetries directoy shows the results from the asymmetry.py code, however. Project is the directory for the stamps from the HST images, so that the Lyman-alpha could be overlaid as contours on top of the HST stamps. LymProject is the directory for the Lyman-alpha stamps that were created. LymCatalog is the lyman alpha image
